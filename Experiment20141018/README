Memo on running an experiment

PREPARATION
Before the scripts can be run, the path variables in 
  [EXPERIMENT]/environ
have to be set according to the environment.

Make sure that the directories
  $filedir  $resultdir  $averagedir
(as specified in environ) are empty
  

GENERATING GAME FILES
In directory
  [EXPERIMENT]/.
call
  scripts-gen-rand-games2/meta-gen <name of generator> <number of gen calls>
  <delta> <iterations>
where
  <name of generator> is one of 
    gen-rand-games  gen-rand-games2  gen-rand-bipartite  gen-steady-rand-games
  <number of gen calls> and <delta> determine the sizes of games graphs
  (i.e. their nodes) to the range
    <delta>, <delta>*2, <delta>*3, ..., <delta>*<number of gen calls>
  <iterations>  determines how many instances of graphs for a particular size
  shall be generated


RUNNING THE EXPERIMENT
In directory
  [EXPERIMENT]/.
call
  scripts-run-experiment/run-all


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
This computes for each size instance the _worst_ case (although the files are
denoted "average" -> need to be renamed!)
In directory
  [EXPERIMENT]/.
call
  scripts-run-experiment/calc-average
